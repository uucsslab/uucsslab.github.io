  content: Today we launch the website of the Uppsala University Computational Social Science Lab, a collaboration between researchers from the Faculty of Social Science and the Faculty of Science and Technology. We are thankful to several initiatives at Uppsala University promoting interdisciplinary research and education. Some of our connections were established or developed at the Centre for Integrated Research on Culture and Society (CIRCUS), at AI4Research, and as part of an initiative for the creation of interdisciplinary courses.
