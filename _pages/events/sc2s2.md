# Swedish Conference on Computational Social Science

**Uppsala, 23-25 April 2024**

The objective of the conference is to bring together researchers from different disciplines interested in using or in the use of computational methods to study or address societally relevant phenomena. The conference is targeted to researchers affiliated with Swedish institutions, to contribute to the establishment of the Computational Social Science (CSS) community in Sweden.

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

 - Computational studies of society (cultural patterns and dynamics, politics, media, ...).
 - Computational methods with applications in social science (social network analysis, natural language processing, computer vision, agent-based models, statistics, causal inference, machine learning,  ...).
 - CSS method development and methodology (validity, replicability, model assessment, statistical theory,  ...).
 - Digital sources of social data (APIs, population-scale data, corpora, image data, audio data, ...).
 - Ethical, legal, and societal aspects of CSS.

The conference will be held in Uppsala on April 23-25, 2024 (lunch to lunch). To have an inclusive event, there will be no registration fee; coffee breaks, lunches, and a social dinner will be provided at no cost. For PhD students and junior researchers with limited funding for travel and accommodation, there are (limited) resources available. We also plan to organise a pre-conference training workshop on April 23 in the morning, at no cost, based on interest and availability.
