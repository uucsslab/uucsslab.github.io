The CSS Lab is a university-wide collaboration for the integration of computational and social sciences, focusing on advanced computational methods, statistical inference, social scientific sensitivity and relevance.

The CSS Lab was established at the end of 2023 by researchers at Uppsala University affiliated with seven departments from the Faculty of Social Sciences and the Faculty of Science and Technology. Our goals are:

- To offer a platform for computational social scientists at Uppsala University to exchange knowledge and establish interdisciplinary collaborations at the intersection of the computational and social sciences.
- To share current research results and knowledge about computational methods for the social sciences with other interested researchers at Uppsala University.
- To interact with other CSS researchers, labs, and hubs in Sweden and internationally.

In 2024 we organised a [National Conference on Computational Social Science](https://uucsslab.github.io/events/sc2s2-2024). In 2025 we are starting a new [seminar series](https://uucsslab.github.io/events/seminars-2025) on Computational Social Science research.
