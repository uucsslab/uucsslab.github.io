The CSS Lab is a university-wide collaboration for the integration of computational and social sciences, focusing on advanced computational methods, statistical inference, social scientific sensitivity and relevance.

The Lab was established at the end of 2023 by researchers at Uppsala University from seven departments at the Faculty of Social Sciences and the Faculty of Science and Technology. In 2024 the Lab organised a [National Conference on Computational Social Science](https://uucsslab.github.io/events/sc2s2-2024). From 2025 we are organising the [CS4 seminar series](https://uucsslab.github.io/events/seminars-2025).
