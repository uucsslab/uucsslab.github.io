The Nordic Observatory for Digital Media and Information Disorder (NORDIS) is a consortium of researchers and fact-checkers from Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and Finland. We are one of the national hubs of The European Digital Media Observatory (EDMO). Our aim is to develop theories, practices and models that can help counteract digital information disorders – the spread of misinformation, disinformation and other forms of harmful information online – and to help empower citizens in the Nordic welfare states to resist such information by enabling them to enhance their media literacy.

The NORDIS consortium is led by Aarhus University's DATALAB. The role of the team at Uppsala University is to evaluate the applicability of network-based models to Nordic data, for example to detect malicious information amplification campaigns or to study the diffusion of information from alternative media.

This project has received seed funding from the European Union under Grant Agreement number INEA/CEF/ICT/A2020/2394203.
